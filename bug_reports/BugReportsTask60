1. User is not deleted if only required parameters are specified in delete request.
Precondition:
Start application.
Get access tokens with 'write' and 'read' scope.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Send POST request to create user to /users endpoint with body.
   {
        "age": 20,
        "name": "Ola",
        "sex": "FEMALE",
        "zipCode": "ABCDE"
   }
2. Send DELETE request with body to delete user with only required parameters:
   {
        "name": "Ola",
        "sex": "FEMALE"
   }
3. Verify list of users by sending GET request to /users endpoint.
Actual result: user is not deleted and exists in response. If user is created with only required parameters it is deleted.
So to delete user we have to specify all parameters of user which we want to delete.
Expected result: user is deleted and does not exist in response. User should be deleted if we specify only required parameters (name and sex)
even if current user has other parameters like zip code and age as well.
