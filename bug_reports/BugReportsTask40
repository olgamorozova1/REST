1. Parameter olderThen for GET request does not include users with age equal to olderThen value.
Precondition:
Start application.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Send POST request to get access token with read scope to endpoint /oauth/token:
POST http://localhost:49000/oauth/token
Header:
Authorization: Basic MG9hMTU3dHZ0dWdmRlhFaFU0eDc6WDdlQkNYcWxGQzd4LW1qeEc1SDkxSVJ2X0JxZTFvcTdad1hOQThhcQ==
Request Body:
grant_type: "client_credentials"
scope: "read"
2. Send POST request to get access token with "write" scope to endpoint /oauth/token.
3. Send POST request to create user with some age (use token with "write" scope).
   POST http://localhost:49000/users
   Header:
   Authorization: Bearer XXXX
   Content-Type: application/json
   Request Body:
   {
     "age": 20,
     "name": "ola",
     "sex": "FEMALE",
     "zipCode": "ABCDE"
   }
5. Send GET request to /users with olderThen parameter:
    GET GET http://localhost:49000/users?olderThan=20
    Header:
    Authorization: Bearer XXXX
    (where XXXX is token from the 1st step)
6. Verify list of users.
Actual result: list of users does not include users with age 20.
Expected result: list of users include users with age 20.
